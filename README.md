# MPC — Moldovan Professionals Chicago

## Overview
A minimal React + Vite + Tailwind static site to host articles, news and jobs for Moldovan professionals in the USA. Posts are simple HTML files placed in `public/posts/` and an `index.json` is generated by running `npm run generate-posts-index`.

## Features
- Home, Articles, Jobs, About pages
- Posts are static HTML files in `public/posts/` and are read without a backend
- Simple Node script to auto-generate `public/posts/index.json` from HTML files
- Ready for static hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages — with small config)

## Quick start
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Add a post: create `public/posts/2025-11-11-my-post.html` and include `<meta name="title" content="My Post">` and `<meta name="date" content="2025-11-11">` at the top.
4. Run `npm run generate-posts-index` to refresh `public/posts/index.json` (or run this as part of your deploy pipeline).

## Deploy
Build with `npm run build` and deploy the `dist/` folder to any static host. Make sure `public/posts/` files are included in the deployed build (Vite copies them to `dist/`).

## Next steps (suggested)
- Add a simple admin form + GitHub Actions workflow to commit new posts via PR.
- Add comments or discussion (Disqus or static discussion service).
- Add job submission form that appends to `public/jobs.json` through a serverless function.
